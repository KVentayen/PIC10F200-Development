# PIC10F200-Development
This a means to learn more about the PIC10F200 Microcontroller.

## Fabrication in the CSUB Fab Lab
The PCB Milling Machine in the CSUB Fab Lab are done using PNG files. The following are specifications for the machine:
- Black lines or shapes in the file are to be milled at the same depth as other lines or shapes in the file
    - Therefore the milled elements such as traces are to be in different files from elements such as the board outline.
- Elements too small of a size (, size is yet to be determined) will not be recognized and will not be documented in the output document.
- Be sure to make the page size the same for all of the files. For example if the page size is 500px by 400px make sure it is consistent with other files.
- Make sure that the resolution is at least 600dpi for the device when exporting the PNG.
- Make sure that the front and the back files of the board are mirrors of each other. (Remember the transformation is dependent on how the actual board is flipped.)

## Project Specific Files
PNG Files for this project have the following specifications:
- Page Size: 60 mm
- Distance from Page Origin to Board Origin:
    - X Value: 10mm
    - Y Value: 10mm
